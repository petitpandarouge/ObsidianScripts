# ObsidianScripts

This project is a TypeScript framework that allows building extension scripts for the following Obsidian plugins : 
- [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/)
- [User Plugins](https://github.com/mnowotnik/obsidian-user-plugins)
- [Quick Add](https://quickadd.obsidian.guide/docs/)

The benefits of this framework are
- having a fully tested code, to easely maintain it,
- having a fully typed code, to easely read it.
