# ObsidianScripts ðŸ“œ

This is the name I use to identify the very first scripts I have written to inflate Obsidian.
They are written in JS, and can be opened using the `ObsidianScripts.code-workspace` file.

It's a good version to work with, but I'm now afraid of modifying them and break something as they are not protected by tests.
This is where `Obsinflate` comes into the game.

I keep them here as I slowly but surely move them into the `Obsinflate` framework.

[![semantic-release: angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/semantic--release-angular-e10079?logo=semantic-release)](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

TypeScript framework that allows building extension scripts for the following Obsidian plugins : 
- [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/)
- [User Plugins](https://github.com/mnowotnik/obsidian-user-plugins)
- [Quick Add](https://quickadd.obsidian.guide/docs/)

## Highlights

The benefits of this framework are
- having a fully tested code, to easely **maintain** it,
- having a fully typed code, to easely **read** it.

The framework is implemented following the [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) method. The tests are then the [specs](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/petitpandarouge/ObsidianScripts/blob/main/obsinflate/reports/test-report.html) ðŸ”¥.

> ðŸ”Ž NOTE : In the whole documentation, I call `inflates` all the scripts implemented using this framework.
