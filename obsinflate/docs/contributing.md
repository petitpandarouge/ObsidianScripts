### Coding Rules

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

- All features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests).
- I follow (as mush as I can) [Google's TypeScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html), but wrap all code at 80 characters.

### Commit message format

The commit message must follow the [AngularJS Commit Message Format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit) and versions are automatically generated following the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) rules.
