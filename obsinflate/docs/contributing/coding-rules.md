# Coding Rules

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

- All features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests).
- I follow (as mush as I can) [Google's TypeScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html), but wrap all code at 80 characters.

In complement, I follow these rules :
- File names are in `camelCase` (ref: https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/styleguide#filename).
- Directory names are in `kebab-case`.
